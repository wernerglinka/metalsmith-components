{#
  render-section is a nunjucks macro that uses the 'section.sectionType' parameter
  to compose the name of the target component macro.
  Since Nunjucks doesn't support dynamic macro names, we have to use a helper
  function to do this. We also pass the required meta data through, e.g., crumbs,
  data, pageFiles, etc.

  Note: previous/next removed in favor of collection object for @metalsmith/collections v2.0
#}

{% macro renderSection(section, crumbs, data, collections, urlPath, collection) %}
  {# include the target section component based on section.sectionType #}
  {# the 'ignore missing' flag prevents errors if the target component doesn't exist #}
  {% include "../sections/" + section.sectionType + "/" + section.sectionType + ".njk" ignore missing %}
{% endmacro %}
